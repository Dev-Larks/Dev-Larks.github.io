Welcome to my new blog a learning experience in using Github pages and Jekyll.

The site theme is based on a theme created by Josh Gerdes called [Jekyll-Uno](https://github.com/joshgerdes/jekyll-uno){:target="_blank"} you can find the source files on Github.

I used the guide by Johnathan McGlone on creating a personal site on Github as my guide to get [started](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/){:target="_blank"}.

The initial issues I had with the Jekyll-Uno site CSS not being applied was resolved by commenting out the **url:** and **baseurl:** entries in the sites _config.yml file.
