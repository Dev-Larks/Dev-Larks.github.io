Thanks for visiting my website.

I've been working in the IT industry for approximately 10 years, I'm currently completing a bachelor degree in Information Technology with a specialisation of business analysis at Charles Sturt University. I first heard about PowerShell back in 2014 and since then have used it to support my day to day tasks, I have an increasing interest in coding and creating solutions to automate my daily tasks. I'm by no means an expert but have a reasonable understanding of the PowerShell language and I'm constantly learning new ways to utilise it effectively. 

I've also recently discovered Linux having completed a server administration subject in Semester 2 of 2020. Initially I was running the Ubuntu based Linux distro Pop!_OS on an old Apple Mac Mini. Given some limitations with using a window manager on this base I moved to a basic Debian install, before ultimately setting on Arch. I'm currently running the Spectrwm window manager on the Mac Mini and have LeftWM installed on a second laptop also running Arch.

The purpose of this site is to capture and document the things I've learned and share them with those who stumble across this site. My aim is to produce content that is clear and easy to understand and that aligns with PowerShell best practices.

### Looking Ahead in 2021
This is the final year of my degree which I've been studying part time and which should be completed by the end of October.

I want to learn how to use the Pester framework to complete unit testing of my code, this will be one of my focuses during 2021. I'm also part way through reading the Creating Modules book by Brandon Olin which you can find on Leanpub, this is an agile book that is still in the process of being written. Finally I also want to complete a first instance of a build pipeline for my modules using Plaster, Platyps and PSBuild.

Thanks for reading, Craig
