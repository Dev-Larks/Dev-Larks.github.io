Thanks for visiting my website.

I've been working in the IT industry for approximately 10 years, I'm currently completing a bachelor degree in Information Technology with a specialisation of business analysis at Charles Sturt University. I first heard about PowerShell back in 2014 and since then have used it to support my day to day tasks, I have an increasing interest in coding and creating solutions to automate my daily tasks. I'm by no means an expert but have a reasonable understanding of the PowerShell language and I'm constantly learning new ways to utilise it effectively. The purpose of this site is to capture things I've learned and share them with those who stumble across this site.

My aim is to produce content that is clear and easy to understand and that aligns with PowerShell best practices.

### Looking Ahead in 2020
I want to learn how to use the Pester framework to complete unit testing of my code, this will be one of my focuses for the remainder of 2020. I'm also part way through reading the Creating Modules book by Brandon Olin which you can find on Leanpub, this is an agile book that is still in the process of being written. Finally I also want to complete a first instance of a build pipeline for my modules using Plaster, Platyps and PSBuild.

Thanks for reading, Craig
